rtfinder - gene finding program for stop codon readthrough


Overview
========

  rtfinder is a kind of gene finder, which is designed solely for
studies on stop codon readthrough.  Given nucleotide sequence(s) as
input (e.g. genome or cDNA), it enumerates all possible ORFs that
have an inframe stop codon.  User can impose several conditions on
the output, such as minimal length of the ORFs.
  rttrain is a yet-experimental program for scoring the ORFs based
on the codon usage of the source organism. It constructs a first
order Markov model, and its output can be supplied to rtfinder.


Installation
============

  The simplest way to install this package is as follows. For more
details, see 'INSTALL'.

  1. ./configure

  2. make

  3. make install


Usage
=====

  Type 'rtfinder' or 'rttrain' in command line.  Then, available
options are printed.
